# Copy default template to cpp files for competitive programming purpose
Let's say you have a list of files:

* A.cpp
* B.cpp
* C.cpp
* ...
* \_\_template\_\_.cpp (must have)

And you want to copy the contents of \_\_template\_\_.cpp to all other .cpp files without having to manually copy it.

Just download the executable file to that directory and then execute, it will looking for \_\_template\_\_.cpp file and then do all of that for you.

This script will automatically skip non .cpp files including folders.
